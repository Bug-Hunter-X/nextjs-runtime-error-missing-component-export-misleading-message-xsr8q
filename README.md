# Next.js Runtime Error: Missing Component Export

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Next.js application where a runtime error occurs due to a missing component export. The error message, however, is misleading and doesn't directly point to the actual problem.

## Problem Description

A Next.js application throws a runtime error. The error message is unclear.  The error occurs when a component is imported but not used in the main component.

## Solution

The solution involves removing the unused component import or explicitly rendering the component in the main component. This repository demonstrates both solutions.  This highlights the importance of cleaning up unused imports to prevent confusing runtime errors.
